# Section 2.4: Work and Energy in Electrostatics

Electrostatics not only describes the forces between stationary charges but also the work involved in moving charges and the energy stored in a charge configuration. Understanding these concepts is essential for analyzing systems of charges and fields.

## 2.4.1 The Work It Takes to Move a Charge

The work required to move a charge $q$ in an electrostatic field $\mathbf{E}$ from point 1 to point 2 is given by:

$$
W = -q \int_{\mathbf{r}_1}^{\mathbf{r}_2} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l}
$$

Alternatively, this can be written in terms of the potential difference between the two points:

$$
W = q \left( \phi(\mathbf{r}_1) - \phi(\mathbf{r}_2) \right)
$$

Here, $\phi(\mathbf{r})$ is the **electric potential** at position $\mathbf{r}$.

#### Example:
For a point charge $q$ moved in the electric field of another point charge $Q$, the work done to move $q$ from distance $r_1$ to $r_2$ from $Q$ is:

$$
W = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{q Q}{r_1} - \frac{q Q}{r_2} \right)
$$

This shows that work depends on the potential difference, not on the path taken, since electrostatic fields are conservative.

## 2.4.2 The Energy of a Point Charge Distribution

The total **electrostatic potential energy** $U$ of a system of point charges is the sum of the pairwise interaction energies between charges. For $N$ point charges $q_1, q_2, \dots, q_N$, the potential energy is:

$$
U = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j>i}^{N} \frac{q_i q_j}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}
$$

This expression calculates the potential energy based on the relative positions of each pair of charges.

#### Example: Two Charges
For two charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ separated by a distance $r_{12}$, the potential energy is:

$$
U = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q_1 q_2}{r_{12}}
$$

#### Example: Three Charges
For three charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the interactions between all pairs:

$$
U = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{q_1 q_2}{r_{12}} + \frac{q_2 q_3}{r_{23}} + \frac{q_3 q_1}{r_{31}} \right)
$$

This method extends to larger systems of charges.

## 2.4.3 The Energy of a Continuous Charge Distribution

For a **continuous charge distribution** with charge density $\rho(\mathbf{r})$, the total electrostatic energy is given by:

$$
U = \frac{1}{2} \int \rho(\mathbf{r}) \phi(\mathbf{r}) \, d^3r
$$

This expression calculates the total energy by integrating the charge density $\rho(\mathbf{r})$ and the electric potential $\phi(\mathbf{r})$ over all space.

Alternatively, the electrostatic energy can be expressed in terms of the electric field $\mathbf{E}$:

$$
U = \frac{\epsilon_0}{2} \int \mathbf{E}^2 \, d^3r
$$

This form emphasizes that the energy is stored in the electric field itself.

#### Energy Density:
The **energy density** $u$ at any point in space, which represents the energy per unit volume, is:

$$
u = \frac{\epsilon_0}{2} \mathbf{E}^2
$$

This shows that the stronger the electric field at a point, the greater the energy stored in that region.

## 2.4.4 Comments on Electrostatic Energy

### 1. Energy of Assembling a Charge Distribution

The electrostatic potential energy of a system of charges can be interpreted as the work required to assemble the charges, starting with them infinitely far apart. For example, in a two-charge system, the energy is the work needed to bring the second charge into the field of the first charge.

### 2. Energy Stored in the Field

The electrostatic energy is stored in the electric field itself. This is evident from the expression for energy in terms of $\mathbf{E}^2$. Even in regions where no charge is present, energy can still be stored in the field.

### 3. Non-superposition of Energy

Unlike the electric field, electrostatic energy **does not** obey the principle of superposition. The total energy is not simply the sum of individual energies but includes interaction terms between charges.

### 4. Energy in Conductors

In conductors, charges rearrange themselves to minimize the electrostatic energy. The electric potential is constant throughout the conductor, and the electric field inside is zero. All charge resides on the surface, with the field outside following Gauss's law.

### 2.4.5 Energy in Continuous Media (Landau)

In **Landauâ€™s Electrodynamics of Continuous Media**, the electrostatic energy in materials with **polarization** is discussed. The energy of a dielectric medium is given by:

$$
U = \frac{1}{2} \int \left( \epsilon_0 \mathbf{E}^2 + \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{P} \right) d^3r
$$

Where:
- $\mathbf{P}$ is the **polarization** of the medium.

This formulation highlights how the energy in a dielectric material is affected by both the free charges (through $\mathbf{E}$) and the bound charges (through $\mathbf{P}$).

### 2.4.6 Feynman on Electrostatic Energy

In the **Feynman Lectures**, Feynman explains that electrostatic energy is stored in the **field** rather than the charges themselves. He discusses the **energy density** of the electric field, focusing on the energy distribution in space.

#### Example:
Feynman provides an intuitive example of a **parallel plate capacitor**, explaining that the energy is stored in the electric field between the plates, with the energy density given by:

$$
u = \frac{\epsilon_0}{2} \mathbf{E}^2
$$

### Conclusion:

**Section 2.4: Work and Energy in Electrostatics** explores how work is required to move charges in an electric field and how energy is stored in the configuration of charges and in the field itself. The expressions for energy in terms of both potential and the electric field provide different perspectives on how electrostatic systems store energy. Insights from **Landau** and **Feynman** deepen the understanding of energy in continuous media and fields.
